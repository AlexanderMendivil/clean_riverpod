# clean_riverpod

This project will implement a clean architecture with riverpod as the state management.

## Executing riverpod (code generator)

we run ```flutter pub run build_runner watch```
<br/>
This will check our code, if we use riverpod decorators it will generate classes for it.

Whenever you create a new piece of state, don't forget to add the generated file as part of your file before.
